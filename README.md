# hello-world
figuring out github
 
Hi everyone, 
This is my first time programming anything at all. I want to learn how to use R and python so that I can manipulate data in interesting ways.

I finished my PhD in December. Then I visited:
* Turkey
* France
* Israel
* Morocco
* Thailand
* Laos
* Vietnam
* Cambodia

I had an amazing time on the Islands in Cambodia.
